# To-Do List

>A pretty to-do list built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a simple application that is everything but *boring*  looking


## Design:

Although it bears a simple yet pretty design and it is practically the most basic build, it is functionable!
 - Has a glass morph like background
 - Hovering buttons
 - Smooth transitions
 - Pleasing to the eye design

### Features:

- You can add as many tasks you want.
- Stays in your browser and remembers your tasks
- The tasks are check-listed (done with your tasks? Tick that task done!!!)
-  Most important!! It is pretty to your eyes!!!

## Why Build such a simple thing?

 Why Not!
Being a college student I have tons of things to accomplish in a day - which feels like less than 24hrs!!!! 
And yes! I need to remind myself to do my laundry!!!! 

 There are tons of to-do list apps over android, but WHAT ABOUT MY LAPPY!!! I can't install a huge jargon of an app on my laptop only to type in some todos!!!
 So, I thought why not just make it! 

 It is simple and easy. I did take help from <sub>tutorials</sub> ... ':)
 
 Anyways...it was fun!
 

## New Update:

The very first version is done YAY!!! [24-10-25]

### Features updated:
- A progress bar!
- The tasks / to-dos are stored in the localstorage of your browser!
- A confetti celebration when you are done with your to-dos!!!


## Next Update:

 I plan on cranking up the feel and working of the application. 

### Features: 

- <s>Progress tracker (a progress bar or ring to show how much task you have finished)</s>
- Turn the web-app into a tiny applet sort of thingy that can just hover on your computer screen like a tiny window
- Integrate Pomodoro timer (I already have a Pomodoro timer application so why not integrate it??)
- meh, we'll see....
