# To-Do List

>A pretty to-do list built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a simple application that is everything but *boring*  looking


## Design:

> [!NOTE]  Although it bears a simple yet pretty design and it is practically the most basic build, it is functionable!
> - Has a glass morph like background
> - Hovering buttons
> - Smooth transitions
> - Pleasing to the eye design

### Features:

`[!!heart||var(--color-purple-rgb)]` You can add as many tasks you want.
`[!!heart||var(--color-purple-rgb)]` Stays in your browser and remembers your tasks
`[!!heart||var(--color-purple-rgb)]` The tasks are check-listed (done with your tasks? Tick that task done!!!)
`[!!heart||var(--color-purple-rgb)]` Most important!! It is pretty to your eyes!!!

## Why Build such a simple thing?

> [!cute] Why Not!
> Being a college student I have tons of things to accomplish in a day - which feels like less than 24hrs!!!! 
> And yes! I need to remind myself to do my laundry!!!! 
> 
> There are tons of to-do list apps over android, but WHAT ABOUT MY LAPPY!!! I can't install a huge jargon of an app on my laptop only to type in some todos!!!
> So, I thought why not just make it! 
> 
> It is simple and easy. I did take help from <sub>tutorials</sub> ... ':)
> 
> Anyways...it was fun!
> 

## Next Update:

> [!innovate] The Plan!
> I plan on cranking up the feel and working of the application. 

### Features: 

`[!!star||var(--color-yellow-rgb)]` Progress tracker (a progress bar or ring to show how much task you have finished)
`[!!star||var(--color-yellow-rgb)]` Turn the web-app into a tiny applet sort of thingy that can just hover on your computer screen like a tiny window
`[!!star||var(--color-yellow-rgb)]` Integrate Pomodoro timer (I already have a Pomodoro timer application so why not integrate it??)
`[!!star||var(--color-yellow-rgb)]` meh, we'll see....
